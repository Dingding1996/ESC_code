This work introduces a frequency-dependent Equivalent Scattering Coefficient (ESC) to quantify the room average degree of scattering per mean-free path resulting from sound wave interactions with objects, elements, and impedance discontinuities. These ESCs can be effectively applied in various hybrid room acoustic models, offering significant potential for high-frequency sound field reconstruction with limited computational resources.
